Homework: Python Lambdas for Polynomials

Rules:
- Write plain Python (no imports, no extra functions beyond what is asked)
- Fill in the code after each task
- Disable Copilot for these exercises

Tips:
- Run the script often to test your work
- Shortcut in VSC to run Python: Ctrl - F5
- If it doesn’t work, you can assign your own shortcut:
  Ctrl + K Ctrl + S → Search "Python: Run Python File in Terminal" → Set Keybinding

# Exercise 1
# Create a template polynomial function of degree 2 using lambda,
# that can then be initialized with concrete parameters.

# Initialize your polynomial with parameters 2, 3 and 1

# Print the result of this polynomial with value 2


# Exercise 2
# Use lambda and args of variable lengths to create a polynomial of arbitrary length
# Hint: Use enumerate and reversed to generate index-coefficient pairs
# and sum() for the result

# Initialize your polynomial with parameters 2, 3, 5 and 1

# Print the result of this polynomial with value 2
